# SQL-challenge

This is my submission for the Module 9 challenge. My submission includes 3 components: table schema script, queries script, and an image of the ERD.

# Data Engineering
In my table schema script, I've created the following tables:
- Titles
- Employees
- Departments
- Department Manager
- Department Employees
- Salaries

# Data Modeling
These same tables are also reflected in the image of the ERD.

# Data Analysis
In my query script, I've included the following queries:
- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
